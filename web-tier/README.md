## ðŸŒŸ Description

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a React.js application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS. 

The pipeline automates the build, Dockerization, and deployment processes to ensure consistent and reliable delivery of the application.

The main features of this project include:

1. **React Application**: A Inventory CRUD application that serves as the base for demonstrating the CI/CD pipeline.
   
2. **Dockerization**: The application is packaged into a Docker container and the Docker image is pushed to DockerHub for easy distribution.
   
3. **AWS Deployment**: Deployment utilizes Amazon ECR for Docker image storage, deploys on Amazon ECS service powered by AWS Fargate.

5. **Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions**: Automated build, dockerization and deployment of the Spring Boot application using GitHub Actions. Every push to the main branch triggers the CI pipeline.

The backend springboot application is also Dockerized and deployed using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS. Explore the backend repository <a href="https://github.com/DharshiBalasubramaniyam/Springboot-CI-CD-Pipeline">here</a>.
